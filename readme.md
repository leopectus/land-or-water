# Land or Water?

This project uses the HERE Maps API for JavaScript and the HERE Advanced Data Sets REST API to check whether a given point (latitude,longitude) is in water or on land. 

> **Note:** In order to get the sample code to work, you **must** replace the `apiKey` strings during platform setup with valid HERE developer credentials.

> You can obtain a set of credentials by signing up for a [Free Account](https://developer.here.com/sign-up?create=Freemium-Basic&keepState=true&step=account) on [developer.here.com](https://developer.here.com/).
